# Who am I?

Hi, I'm Doug Kissack!  I'm a Pennsylvania native, United States Navy veteran, and honors graduate of Nucamp's full-stack software engineering bootcamp.  I got my first taste of the industry in the Navy in 2012 when, as an Aegis missile defense technician, I assisted civilian contractors with Ada and Python programming.  For the next decade or so, I pursued coding as a hobbyist while transitioning to civilian life and starting my family.  In 2022, dissatisfied with my career as a sales engineer and looking to make a change to a more challenging and creative industry, I at long last pulled the trigger and started my transition to coding professionally.

Outside of work, I hold a bachelor's degree in environmental science with a focus on data analysis, data visualization, and GIS.  I created and run the Biodiversity365 learning platform (https://biodiversity365.com/), an educational resource focused on illuminating the challenges of biodiversity conservation through storytelling and interactive data visualization.  I'm also an avid game designer, game developer, and creative writer.  I feel most at home when creating, which is why software development fits me like a glove!  Lastly, I'm very active in my community, supporting conservation initiatives and the local autism support services group (in support of and alongside my son, who is autistic).

I currently work in a freelance capacity on a project-by-project basis, but I'm open to entry level or intermediate roles in full-stack, front-end, or back-end development.  Please feel free to contact me with inquiries (or just to say hello!) at dmkcodes@gmail.com.

Always learning,
Doug

# Technical Skills

This app was created using React, Redux, Bootstrap, and SASS.  Biodiversity365, which is a more current example of my comprehensive skillset, incorporates the full MERN stack, as well as RTK Query, Mongoose, JWT, and various data visualization tools including Recharts and Scrollama.  

My focus is on robust, secure, and dynamic full-stack development.  I am actively advancing my skills in Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, and I am also proficient with Python, Flask, Docker, and SQL, though they are not my primary areas of focus at this time.
